## Bayesian Optimization Algorithm

Language: Polish.

Presentation of the concept of Bayesian Optimization Algoritm (Pelikan, 1996) that takes the idea of probabilistic model--building genetic algorithms (PMBGAs) and merges it with bayesian networks. Talk explores its deeper context within theoretic explorations of behaviour of genetic algoritms, and how it relates to other PMBGAs. It also addresses relative failure of BOA as a model that found its applications despite its robust theoretical underpinnings. More modern alternatives for similar models are also briefly mentioned.

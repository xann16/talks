## Learning Object Bounding Boxes for 3D Instance Segmentation on Point Clouds

Language: Polish.

Presentation of paper by B. Yang et al.: *Learning Object Bounding Boxes for 3D Instance Segmentation on Point Clouds* (NIPS 2019) [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01140)|[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01140.pdf)|[pdf (local copy)](src/bonet-paper.pdf)]. It proposes a novel deep learning model (3D-BoNet) for instance segmentation on 3D point clouds, that is *end-to-end* trainable, has simple architecture (MLP), and is computationally more efficient.

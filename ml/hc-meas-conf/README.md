## Confident Head Circumterence Measurement from Ultrasound with Real-time Feedback for Sonographers

Language: Polish.

Presentation of paper by S. Budd et al.: *Confident Head Circumterence Measurement from Ultrasound with Real-time Feedback for Sonographers* (2019) [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02582)|[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02582)|[pdf (local copy)](src/1908.02582v1.pdf)]. It explores application of probabilistic alternatives to U-Net (*Probabilistic U-Net* and Monte *Carlo Dropout*) for sampling semantic segmentation masks, and use such sets of samples to provide user with confidence scores and bounds of performed measurements of fetal head circumterence from US images.

Delivered on 26.03.2020 for seminar on *Computer Vision and Image Recognition* (moderated by B. Zieliński), Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland.

## DNS and LES Simulations for Particle-Laden Turbulent Flows with Two-Way Momentum Coupling

Language: English.

**Abstract:** Turbulent fluid flows with particles dispersed within it are common occurrence in nature, as well as in many technological processes. Important example of such case are atmospheric clouds that consist of small droplets of water aerosol suspended in air. Understanding the interplay between air (fluid) and aerosol (particles) is crucial to understanding atmospheric phenomena. Performing numerical simulations on a fine scale is one way of studying such phenomena and obtaining statistics, such as collision kernels, that may be used as parameterisations for models used on larger scales. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is a relatively precise method that is viable for such simulations, although they require a lot of computational resources, making larger simulations still completely out of reach. For that reason, Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) are also employed, as they use parametrisation for small-scale turbulent phenomena, which reduces required grid size (and, thus, computational complexity) at the cost of some precision and physical fidelity. This talk summarizes part of the project of the National Science Center (NCN) OPUS14/2017: "Turbulent flow analysis with the dispersion phase - the impact of two-sided coupling of momentum and gravity on particle motion statistics" supervised by Prof. Bogdan Rosa (IMGW-PIB). It focuses on comparing the precision of DNS and LES methods for obtaining statistics of particles in turbulent flows that involve two-way momentum coupling between particles and fluid.

## Charles S. Peirce a kwestia aktualności kantowskiej filozofii matematyki i jej konsekwencje

Language: Polish.

Title in English: **Charles S. Peirce and question of contemporary viability of Kantian philosophy of mathematics and its consequences**

Talk exploring accounts of Kantian assertion that at least some propositions in mathematics are synthetic in nature (mostly by Russell, Beck and Hintikka). Then Peircean distinction between corrolarial and theorematic reasoning is introduced, trying to salvage and reconstruct intents behind that Kantian statement. Finally some consequences of such interpretation are presented, distinguishing between more *static* and more *dynamic* accounts of mathematics as such, and how it historically influenced philosophical views on mathematics.

Delivered on 04.06.2011 during conference *Immanuel Kant -- ontologia i teoria poznania* (*Immanuel Kant -- ontology and epistemology*) organised by KNF UJ (Institute of Philosophy, Faculty of Philosophy, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland).

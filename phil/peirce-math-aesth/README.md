## Matematyka a estetyka w ujęciu Charlesa S. Peirce'a

Language: Polish.

Title in English: **Mathematics and Aesthetics in the Philosophy of Charles S. Peirce**

Talk that places mathematics and aesthetics within philosophical system of Charles S. Peirce. Both discipines are analyzed from the perspective of Peire's phenomenological categories, and his account of reasoning that takes place in mathematical studies (distinction of corrolarial and theorematic reasoning). It is shown how these accounts lead to the conclusion that mathematics and aesthetics exhibit strong similarities within Peircean philosophy.

### Machine Learning [**ml**]

Topics in machine learning and deep learning:

### Artificial Intelligence [**ai**]

Topics in broadly understood domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive science (does not include machine learning and deep learning specific talks):

 - **[boa](ai/boa)** (2019)[PL] -- on Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA) that combines conceptss of genetic algorithms and Bayesian networks, as well as its theoretical underpinnings, and lack of practical success.

### Philosophy [**phil**]

Topics in philosophy (mostly focus on philosophy of Charles S. Peirce, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mathematics):

 - **[peirce-kant-synth-math](phil/peirce-kant-synth-math)** (2011)[PL] -- attempt to salvage Kantian assertion that mathematic knowledge is synthetic using Peircean distinction between corrolarial and theorematic reasoning (and further exploration of consequences of that perspective on interpreting history and philosophy of mathematics).

 - **[peirce-math-aesth](phil/peirce-math-aesth)** (2011)[PL] -- explores the place that both mathematics and aesthetics occupy in the broad framework of philosophy of Charles. S. Peirce, as well as their close relationship.

 - **[sem-cybsp](phil/sem-cybsp)** (2011)[PL] -- analysis of several linguistical contexts in which human beings speak and reason about themselves, and attempt to expand that list to include new, rapidly growing human environment: electronic world, or cyberspace.
